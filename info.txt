Directory houses stuff required to deal with Speaker Change Detection Problem

Description of which stuff is where:

The directory, wav contains:
The audio files for train,val and test purposes.
The driectory, vad contains:
The ground truth files for the TIMIT data set.

We also have to account for the number of various ways in which we can make speaker changed files.
It can be S1-S2, or S1-S2 overlap, or S1-S2-S1, or many other such ways.

Discuss with Sir, as to which all to take, and correspondingly either alter the directory structure, or make directories in the existing structure.

UPDATE[5/6/17]: Discussion with Sir
We won't be taking silence, and also we won't be taking overlapped speech, atleast right now.
Also, we are fixing some parameters which decide which label to give to a frame.
If the ratio of speaker 1 to speaker 2 in a frame is greater then, 0.1 then we label the frame as speaker change frame.
If the ratio is less than that, we label the frame as non speaker change frame
Also, if a frame has ratio greater than 0.1 of silence frames, we label it something else.

Labels:
0: Single speaker frame
1: Speaker change frame[With 10% condition]
2: Silence frame[With 10% condition]
